This is a short review of my use of GPT4 at a more intense period of more than a week.

## Code Generator
The key to using GPT4 as a code generator, is to be more linear with our requirements.  There should be less logical complexity in our prompts, partly because we may not be sufficiently good in English to create logically complicated prompts that GPT4 can understand correctly.  There are always variances in the understanding of the English language, even with human beings.  In addition, it would help to pace our prompts, ie. we should not give GPT4 all our requirements in one prompt.  We should spread out our requirements delivery over several prompts.  This modular approach to prompting will also allow GPT4 to build the code in a sequentially and linear manner with less errors, although errors will definitely be there.  The main takeaway from my GPT4 prompting is that GPT4 will overcome the errors after more feedback about the errors are given through testing with trail and error.

At a broader level, after working on a lengthy conversation with GPT4, it may help to restart another conversation or chat with GPT4.  This is especially so after having a lengthy and meandering conversation with GPT4, which may fracture the sensibilities and logic of GPT4, such that it repeats answers or couldn't quite capture the right solutions to the problems presented to it.  When I restart conversations with GPT4 for code generation, I'll usually first tell it all the requisite files of the project that have already been built properly with its help, because GPT4 do not carry memories of conversations beyond that same conversation thread.

## Code Explainer
Based on experience, GPT4 appears to be able to take in 400-500 lines of code in one prompt, and give a good general summary of the code.  To ensure a more detailed and clear explanation of the code, it may help to reduce to one or two functions or modules consisting of several lines in a prompt.

## Text Explainer
GPT4's ability as a text explainer mirrors that of its ability as a code explainer.  When we want GPT4 to explain a paper, first ensure that the paper can be converted to text only.  Then, for an overall and general understanding of the paper, we'll copy all the text of the paper, and prompt GPT4 over a few prompts if the paper is too long.  After that, narrow down to prompting specific sections that we find difficult to understand for GPT4 to explain.  This can also be done for rules and regulations, contracts, or court cases.

## Questions Answerer
GPT4 is a question answerer.  Whether we ask it to explain code or do textual analysis, just prompt with the right questions after delivering prompts giving the context, and GPT4 will usually provide adequate answers.
