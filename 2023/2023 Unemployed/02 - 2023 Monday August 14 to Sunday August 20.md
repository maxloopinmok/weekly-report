This report is updated as of Sunday 11.59pm this week.  I was mainly preoccupied with bowel movement issues this week, and even went to CGH A&E to resolve my bowel issues.  This is a layout of the tasks I've done:

- My job was to rate Apps from PlayStore that show up through a IT platform excellently.  By doing so, I get some profit.  I had to deposit $50 to start the job game, and twice, the platform's game system reduced my account balance to negative, forcing me to deposit an extra $60 and $70 on 2 occasions to bring my balance to positive in order to continue the job game.  In the end, I made a profit of about $50, and withdrew all my money.
