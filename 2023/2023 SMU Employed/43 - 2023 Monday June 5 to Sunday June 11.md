As of Sunday 3.40pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Eight Subtasks:

### 1) Review the Well Typed Haskell videos, code and readings.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I've completed listening to: https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/introduction.html.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://chat.well-typed.com/cclaw/channels/town-square
    - https://code.well-typed.com/maxloo
    - https://code.well-typed.com/cclaw/haskell-course
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/haskellbook/blob/course-test/nonhaskellbook/course/test/app/Main.hs
    - https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2019/05/integrated-shrinking/#fn1
    - https://research.chalmers.se/publication/517894/file/517894_Fulltext.pdf
    - https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/

To Do:
  - Listen to https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/datatypes-and-functions.html.  

### 2) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I may explore more NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- This dovetails with Item 4 due to the exploration of way impress.js works in presenting slides of FTAs.
- This dovetails with Item 6 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.
- I'm reading widely on these topics.  
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/mti
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/bert
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Content%20Sources.md

To Do:
- Retry LegalBERT or try roBERTa, based on this:
    - https://github.com/coollx/Relevant-Difference-Detector-for-Legal-Text/tree/master

### 3) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- FTA Slideshow created.  Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/examples/fta/index.html
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/src/impress.js
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue

### 4) Learning AWS S3, Textract, DynamoDB
Actions:
- Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse?browseBy=type&filter=18

### 5) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- This dovetails with Item 3 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.  The latest findings are listed in Item 3.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Review%20of%20GPT4%20from%20a%20user%20perspective.md

### 6) Encode S10 of policy into L4 with considerations and trade-offs in comments
Actions:
- Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u5aizEaRfnDJD7N0Zz4pJeBd3lMx36BdqKwdE-lppV8/edit#gid=0
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZrYqf87UZGzEfz_vxYXFl-v7vlyddweYNy6wtV2WEU/edit#gid=1890284544

### 7) Debug the multi-head code in vue-pure-pdpa, Update the click-through on the vue webapp
Actions:
- I've managed to resolve the python3.11.3-poetry issue and got the sidebar on the LegalSpreadsheet to show properly using a local instance on the CCLAW server, but the main multi-head debugging task is handled by another colleague.  
- I've updated the click-through on the vue webapp: when you click through the radio buttons they grey out as they already do, but the height of the div with the class question-content doesn't change.
