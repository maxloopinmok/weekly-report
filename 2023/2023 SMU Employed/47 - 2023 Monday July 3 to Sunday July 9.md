I've been given my letter of termination this week.  From now on, I'm not required to attend any meetings.  My Principal Investigator has informed me that he will give me a week's notice if I need to make any presentations to the rest of the team.  As of Sunday 11.30pm this week, I have worked on the following:
- Listen to Udemy training videos:
    - LangChain: Develop AI web-apps with JavaScript and LangChain
    - Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate 2023 NEW DVA-C02
- read widely from news, articles and books related to AI, LLMs, tech, and self improvement
- applied to a number of jobs
