As of Monday 11.30pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Seven Subtasks:

### 1) Attend the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am and 10am on alternating weeks over a few months.
Actions:
- In progress.
- Some relevant links:

### 2) Attend the Well Typed Haskell course on Monday at 3pm.
Actions:
- In progress.

    - https://code.well-typed.com/maxloo
    - https://code.well-typed.com/cclaw/haskell-course

### 3) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I may explore more NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- This may dovetail with Item 6 in this report due to a common future exploration of BERT.
- Some relevant links:

    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue

### 4) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- I've installed and tried impress.js, but find the controls confusing.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/js/impress.js
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/tree/fta/css

To Do:
- Try to get a general understanding of the code.

### 5) Learning AWS S3, Textract, DynamoDB
Actions:
- Have not worked on this due to work on other tasks.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse?browseBy=type&filter=18

### 6) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- This may dovetail with Item 3 in this report due to a common future exploration of BERT.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Review%20of%20GPT4%20from%20a%20user%20perspective.md

### 7) Encode S10 of policy into L4 with considerations and trade-offs in comments

### 8) [Stage 2] [everyone] **Sketch** backend implementation (but NOT the compiler)
Actions:
- I've created a draft webpage frontend and backend implementation plan with the help of GPT4.

### 9) Testing Parsr and other PDF text extraction tools
- I've tried Parsr but unsure if it has run properly because output file with text extracted from pdf is not found.
- I've found and tried successfully an alternative: pdf2htmlEX.
