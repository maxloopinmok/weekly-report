As of Sunday 11.15pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Nine Subtasks:

### 1) Attend the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am and 10am on alternating weeks over a few months.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I attended the Mirdin Unit 6 lecture at 11am on Monday.
- I completed the Unit 5 homework, and tried to read another optional reading from Unit 5, but could not comprehend some parts of it due to the possible use of LaTeX.

### 2) Attend the Well Typed Haskell course on Monday at 3pm.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I tried to understand and tried to code a couple of the suggested readings without the use of GPT4, but ended up with many problems, which were not resolved by the trainers, so I had to use Google to get some solutions, which was a lot more time consuming than just simply asking GPT4.  The problems also could not all be resolved by Googling alone, but even if GPT4 is used, there may not be a clear solution if the trainers themselves do not feel that they should teach properly the very materials that they themselves may have created or recommended.  It's a shame actually, because I've set aside most of the week to work on this as seen from my questions in the discussion forum, but now it's weekend, and the trainers are missing and could not answer our questions, even though weekends are the best time to study and work on the learning for people who are working.

### 3) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I may explore more NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- This may dovetail with Item 6 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.
- Nothing here this week.
