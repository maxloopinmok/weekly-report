This week, I worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Seven Subtasks:

### 1) Attend the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am and 10am on alternating weeks over a few months.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I attended the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am for what should be the Unit 5 lecture.
- I completed the readings and exercises for Unit 4 with a lot of help from GPT4.

### 3) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- In progress.
- Successfully developed a workable mockup with a lot of help from GPT4 and Copilot in less than a week.
- This pair programming approach has helped me overcome many difficulties in learning unfamiliar areas of coding.

### 6) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- Have not directly worked on this due to work on other tasks.
- I have indirectly contributed to my understanding of GPT4 through using it for my other tasks.
To Do:
- I plan to do a brief markdown review datelined Thursday 13 April 2023, focusing on GPT4 from a user perspective.
- I'll focus on 2 aspects of its use: as a code generator and explainer, and as a text explainer and questions answerer.
- I'll test out the second aspect on some legal case: https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/judgments/judgments-case-summaries.

### 7) Encode S10 of policy into L4 with considerations and trade-offs in comments
Actions:
- Tried encoding a couple of contractual statements:
