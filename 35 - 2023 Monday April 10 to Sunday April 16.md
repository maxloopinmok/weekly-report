As of Sunday 11pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Seven Subtasks:

### 1) Attend the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am and 10am on alternating weeks over a few months.
Actions:
- In progress.
- There were no Mirdin lesson this week.
- I started reading about the exercises and tasks to be done for Unit 5.
- I also read the blog post "The Algebra of Algebraic Data Types, Part 1".
- Some relevant links:

    - https://app.slack.com/client/T012Q6P08BY/C04N48SN57V

### 2) Attend the Well Typed Haskell course on Monday at 3pm.
Actions:
- In progress.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://chat.well-typed.com/cclaw/channels/town-square
    - https://code.well-typed.com/maxloo
    - https://code.well-typed.com/cclaw/haskell-course

### 3) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I'm also exploring NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/mti
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue

NLP Done:
- Extract the text content from the HTML documents using Beautiful Soup.
- Preprocess the text using spaCy (have not tried NLTK) (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, or lemmatizing).
- Use Gensim or another similarity analysis library to find similarities between the preprocessed text.  (Only tried cosine similarity and bag of words, and results were too simplistic for anything useful, but admittedly, I'm also not sure if the results were completely correct)

Yet To Do:
- Use difflib to create a report that highlights the differences and similarities between the documents.
- Send the report back to the frontend Vue.js app and display it in the lower right section of the webpage.

### 4) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- Yet to really begin due to work on other tasks.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js

To Do:
- Try to get a general understanding of the code.

### 5) Learning AWS S3, Textract, DynamoDB
Actions:
- Have not worked on this due to work on other tasks.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse?browseBy=type&filter=18

### 6) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- I've done a user level review of GPT4 based on my experiences using it to develop code, and learn and get answers.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Review%20of%20GPT4%20from%20a%20user%20perspective.md

### 7) Encode S10 of policy into L4 with considerations and trade-offs in comments
Actions:
- Tried encoding several contractual statements.
- Some relevant links:

### 8) [Stage 2] [everyone] **Sketch** backend implementation (but NOT the compiler)
Actions:
- Have not worked on this.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://app.asana.com/0/1204211889758721/1204379268152484/f

To Do:
- Explore and create some specifications for a program, possibly through use of GPT4 prompts.

### 9) Testing Parsr and other PDF text extraction tools
- Tried Parsr but unsure if it has run properly because output file with text extracted from pdf is not found.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://pypi.org/project/parsr-client/
    - https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr
