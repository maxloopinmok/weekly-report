As of Thursday 4pm this week, I worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Seven Subtasks:

### 1) Attend the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am and 10am on alternating weeks over a few months.
Actions:
- In progress.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://advanced-software-design.disco.co/p/advanced-software-design-feb-2023/dashboard
    - https://app.slack.com/client/T9F5D6U4R/C04MPE8AULX
    - https://app.slack.com/client/T012Q6P08BY/C04N48SN57V

### 2) Attend the Well Typed Haskell course on Monday at 3pm.
Actions:
- In progress.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://chat.well-typed.com/cclaw/channels/town-square
    - https://code.well-typed.com/maxloo
    - https://code.well-typed.com/cclaw/haskell-course

### 3) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I'm also exploring NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/mti
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue
To Do:
- Extract the text content from the HTML documents using Beautiful Soup.
- Preprocess the text using NLTK or spaCy (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, or lemmatizing).
- Use Gensim or another similarity analysis library to find similarities between the preprocessed text.
- Use difflib to create a report that highlights the differences and similarities between the documents.
- Send the report back to the frontend Vue.js app and display it in the lower right section of the webpage.

### 4) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- Yet to really begin due to work on other tasks.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js
To Do:
- Try to get a general understanding of the code.

### 5) Learning AWS S3, Textract, DynamoDB
Actions:
- Have not worked on this due to work on other tasks.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse?browseBy=type&filter=18

### 6) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- I've done a user level review of GPT4 based on my experiences using it to develop code, and learn and get answers.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Review%20of%20GPT4%20from%20a%20user%20perspective.md

### 7) Encode S10 of policy into L4 with considerations and trade-offs in comments
Actions:
- Tried encoding several contractual statements.
- Some relevant links:

### 8) [Stage 2] [everyone] **Sketch** backend implementation (but NOT the compiler)
Actions:
- Have not worked on this.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://app.asana.com/0/1204211889758721/1204379268152484/f
To Do:
- Explore and create some specifications for a program, possibly through use of GPT4 prompts.

### 9) Testing Parsr
- Tried but failed to get it to run. 
- Some relevant links:
    - https://pypi.org/project/parsr-client/
    - https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr
    - https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr/blob/master/server/defaultConfig.json
