This report is updated as of Monday 1am this week.  I'm on medical leave on Monday and Tuesday due to a persistent sore throat, cough and running nose.  This is a layout of the tasks I plan to do:

### 1) Apply for jobs.
- My job search and job applications focus on data, AI, GPT and bioinformatics related jobs.  

### 2) Search for and read langchain or AI/LLM related content.

### 3) Try a few langchains.  

### 4) Read the news to understand the economic and business context behind the tech.  

### 5) Try to review and clear my printed notes.  

### 6) Attend more events, both online and in person.  

### 7) Assess possible courses to take and taking them.
