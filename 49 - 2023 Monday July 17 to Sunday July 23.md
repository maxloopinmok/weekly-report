This report is updated as of Monday 1am this week.  I'm on medical leave on Monday and Tuesday due to a persistent sore throat, cough and running nose.  This is a layout of the tasks I plan to do:

### 1) Apply for jobs.
- My job search and job applications focus on data, AI, GPT and bioinformatics related jobs.  

### 2) Search for and read langchain or AI/LLM related content.
- completed watching https://www.linkedin.com/learning/gpt-4-foundations-building-ai-powered-apps/welcome-to-gpt-4-foundations?u=21102035
- watched parts of https://nlbsg.udemy.com/course/langchain-develop-ai-web-apps-with-javascript-and-langchain/learn/lecture/38093174

### 3) Try a few langchains.  

### 4) Read the news to understand the economic and business context behind the tech.  
- primarily reviewed articles from https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Content%20Sources.md#selected-sources-for-focus

### 5) Try to review and clear my printed notes.
