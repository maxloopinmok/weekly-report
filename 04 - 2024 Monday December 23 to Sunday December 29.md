    - According to my check, such an issue should be checked with the plugin's developers or you can try to add the sitemap manually: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9510/2225/how-to-use-sitemap/
- hi, why is my website identified as a scam website?  https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/news-and-books.com
    - If your website is being flagged as a "scam website" on ScamAdviser or similar services, there could be several reasons behind this. These platforms typically assess websites based on a variety of criteria to determine if they might be suspicious or potentially harmful.
    - Websites with very recent domain registrations (especially if registered for a short period) may raise red flags, as scammers often use temporary domains for fraudulent activities.
    - If your domain or associated IP has been previously flagged for hosting malicious content or involved in fraudulent activities, it could be automatically flagged.
    - Lack of transparent contact information (such as a physical address, phone number, or email) is a common characteristic of scam websites. Ensure you have clear and accessible ways for customers to reach you.
    - If your site makes unrealistic promises or presents content in a misleading way, such as unrealistic discounts or "too good to be true" deals, it can trigger scam alerts.
    - Scam and phishing websites often lack reviews or social proof that confirms the legitimacy of their business. If your website has very little or no reviews, or if it has fake-looking reviews, it can be flagged.
    - If your website has been reported for phishing, malware, or being associated with spammy or malicious content in the past, these reports can result in it being flagged by ScamAdviser.
    - Not having a clear privacy policy, terms of service, or return policy can raise suspicion. Legitimate websites typically have clear, well-defined policies to ensure transparency and build trust with users
    - If your website's content is low-quality, copied from other sources, or contains irrelevant/unhelpful information, it can appear untrustworthy. Websites that provide real value to users are less likely to be flagged as scams.
    - Per my check, in Sucuri, the website doesn't contain malware https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/results/news-and-books.com
    - Still, if you wish, we can initiate a scan of your hosting account for any viruses additionally. The scan report is going to be saved as a "TXT" file to your cPanel account >> "File Manager" menu >> "home" folder. The scan will show what potential vulnerabilities there are in the account and what malware and exploits still remain in it. Using the report, you can start cleaning up your hosting space from unwanted content. Here's the guide on how to work with the report: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/10227/2194/how-to-work-with-the-scan-report/
    - As for other possible reasons for flagging as scams. they should be examined with the developer.
- thanks, there was a questionable woocommerce plugin that comes installed after i've set up my website with a theme. do these plugins come with the theme we choose?  i've already removed the plugin because it seems to be causing the ecommerce messages from the scam alert website, but after i removed it, it hasn't changed...
    - This should not be related to the WooCommerce plugin. This is a well-known and reputable plugin.

- have you gone through the list of plugins installed in my account? are any of them questionable?  here's the list of plugins if you haven't checked:
Akismet Anti-spam: Spam Protection
Backuply Pro
Classic Widgets
Extendify WordPress Onboarding and AI Assistant
FileOrganizer Pro
GoSMTP Pro
LiteSpeed Cache
Loginizer
Loginizer Security
Mobile Menu
Pagelayer Pro
PopularFX Website Templates
Site Assistant
SiteSEO Pro
SoftWP
SpeedyCache Pro
WooCommerce
WP Robots Txt
WP Statistics
XML Sitemap Generator for Google
Yoast SEO
    - While most of the plugins in your list are reputable and widely used, there are a few (like Backuply Pro, FileOrganizer Pro, GoSMTP Pro, Pagelayer Pro, Site Assistant, SiteSEO Pro, SoftWP and SpeedyCache Pro) that should be handled with extra caution. For these, make sure to research the developer, read reviews, and verify that they are being regularly updated and supported. When in doubt, prefer well-known alternatives with a proven track record.
- umm... actually these plugins that u identified are the recommended plugins when i use your softaculous program to install my wordpress along with my theme... so i do not know that they are questionable?  fileorganiser might have been installed by me separately, i can't remember the details, but softaculous recommended a lot of plugins.
    - If they were installed through Softaculous during the WordPress installation, they are safe.
- ok, thanks, i'll wait a few days and see if the scam alert website changes its information about my website.
