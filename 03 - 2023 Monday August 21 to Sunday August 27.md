This report is updated as of Saturday 11.59pm this week.  I had bowels moving problems at the start of the week.  In addition, I fell sick on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I slept my Wednesday away.  However, I had also spent some time listening to the speeches of Singapore's Presidential Hopefuls and sharing my views on Facebook.
