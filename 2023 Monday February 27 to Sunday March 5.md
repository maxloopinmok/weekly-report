I read about the DEA project article "Supporting the next level of Digital Economy Agreements".
I briefly surveyed https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.theia and chatted with ChatGPT about Eclipse Theia, Eclipse Che, JetBrains Space, Ace, Monaco, CodeMirror, GitLens, and about displaying 3 or more embedded code editors that can access Git repositories, and about accessing Google Drive and displaying Google Sheets from an embedded editor in a HTML file, that can also run Google Apps Script to access and download data from other web servers.
I developed a quick and basic web prototype for the MTI project:
