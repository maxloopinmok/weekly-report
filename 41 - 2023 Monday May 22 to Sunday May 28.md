As of Sunday 3.45pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Nine Subtasks:

### 1) Attend the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am and 10am on alternating weeks over a few months.
Actions:
- In progress.
- There are no more lectures and tutorials for Mirdin on Monday.
- I completed and submitted the Unit 6 tutorial exercises.  
- Some relevant links:
    - https://advanced-software-design.disco.co/p/advanced-software-design-feb-2023/dashboard

    - https://app.slack.com/client/T012Q6P08BY/C04N48SN57V

### 2) Review the Well Typed Haskell videos, code and readings.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I've started reading and listening to: https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/introduction.html.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://chat.well-typed.com/cclaw/channels/town-square
    - https://code.well-typed.com/maxloo
    - https://code.well-typed.com/cclaw/haskell-course
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/haskellbook/blob/course-test/nonhaskellbook/course/test/app/Main.hs

    - https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/

### 3) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I may explore more NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- This dovetails with Item 4 due to the exploration of way impress.js works in presenting slides of FTAs.
- This may dovetail with Item 6 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.
- I tried privateGPT and gpt4all, but without much success because these are ready made tools with limitations on the prompt input length or the response output length.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/mti
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/bert

To Do:
- Retry LegalBERT or try roBERTa, based on this:
    - https://github.com/coollx/Relevant-Difference-Detector-for-Legal-Text/tree/master

### 4) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- FTA Slideshow created.  Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/examples/fta/index.html
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/src/impress.js

### 5) Learning AWS S3, Textract, DynamoDB
Actions:
- Nothing here this week.
- Have not worked on this due to work on other tasks.

### 6) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- This dovetails with Item 3 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.  The latest findings are listed in Item 3.
- Some relevant links:
