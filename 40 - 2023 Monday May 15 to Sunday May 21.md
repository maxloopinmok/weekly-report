I'd like to add that on last Tuesday, I had a medical appointment in the morning.  I also have medical appointments on Wednesday and Friday this week.  As of Tuesday 11.45pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Nine Subtasks:

### 1) Attend the Mirdin course on Monday at 11am and 10am on alternating weeks over a few months.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I attended the Mirdin Unit 6 tutorial at 10am on Monday.

    - https://app.slack.com/client/T012Q6P08BY/C04N48SN57V

### 2) Review the Well Typed Haskell videos, code and readings.
Actions:
- In progress.
- Nothing here this week.

### 3) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I may explore more NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- This dovetails with Item 4 due to the exploration of way impress.js works in presenting slides of FTAs.
- This may dovetail with Item 6 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.
- I successfully tried SBERT or Sentence-BERT.
- Some relevant links:

    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/bert

To Do:
- Retry LegalBERT.

### 4) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- FTA Slideshow created.  Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/examples/fta/index.html
