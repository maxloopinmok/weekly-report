As of Sunday 5pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Eight Subtasks:

### 1) Review the Well Typed Haskell videos, code and readings.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I'm now listening to: https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/datatypes-and-functions.html.
- I've also tried some of the code.
- Some relevant links:

    - https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2019/05/integrated-shrinking/#fn1
    - https://research.chalmers.se/publication/517894/file/517894_Fulltext.pdf
    - https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/

To Do:
  - Listen to https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/higher-order-functions.html.
  - Listen to https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/polymorphism-and-overloading.html.
  - Listen to https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/io-and-explicit-effects.html.
  - Listen to https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/monads.html.

### 2) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I may explore more NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- This dovetails with Item 4 due to the exploration of way impress.js works in presenting slides of FTAs.
- This dovetails with Item 6 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.
- I'm reading widely on related news and topics.  
- Some relevant links:

    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/bert
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Content%20Sources.md

To Do:
- Retry LegalBERT or try roBERTa, based on this:
    - https://github.com/coollx/Relevant-Difference-Detector-for-Legal-Text/tree/master

### 3) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- FTA Slideshow created.  Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:

### 5) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- This dovetails with Item 3 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.  The latest findings are listed in Item 3.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Review%20of%20GPT4%20from%20a%20user%20perspective.md
