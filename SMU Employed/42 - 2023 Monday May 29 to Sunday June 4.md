This week, I have medical appointments on Tuesday morning and Thursday afternoon.  As of Sunday 8.50pm this week, I have worked on the following:

# Primary Task:
- To learn how to do better programming and researching to support and contribute to our projects.

## Eight Subtasks:

### 1) Review the Well Typed Haskell videos, code and readings.
Actions:
- In progress.
- I'm still listening to: https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/introduction.html.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://chat.well-typed.com/cclaw/channels/town-square
    - https://code.well-typed.com/maxloo
    - https://code.well-typed.com/cclaw/haskell-course
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/haskellbook/blob/course-test/nonhaskellbook/course/test/app/Main.hs
    - https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2019/05/integrated-shrinking/#fn1
    - https://research.chalmers.se/publication/517894/file/517894_Fulltext.pdf
    - https://teaching.well-typed.com/courses/intro/

### 2) Develop a workflow to load in the article chunks (FTA/...../*.html) into the web mockup
Actions:
- Completed.
- As an extension to this task, I may explore more NLP to compare the HTML documents.
- This dovetails with Item 4 due to the exploration of way impress.js works in presenting slides of FTAs.
- This dovetails with Item 6 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.
- I subscribed to AAAS Science and Nature Machine Intelligence to access their content in this area.
- I've also read widely from different sources on relevant topics.  
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/mti
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/bert

To Do:
- Retry LegalBERT or try roBERTa, based on this:
    - https://github.com/coollx/Relevant-Difference-Detector-for-Legal-Text/tree/master

### 3) Take a look at the impress.js repo and see how to adapt that framework for our needs
Actions:
- FTA Slideshow created.  Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/examples/fta/index.html
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/impress.js/blob/fta/src/impress.js
    - https://github.com/smucclaw/usecases/tree/main/vue

### 4) Learning AWS S3, Textract, DynamoDB
Actions:
- Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/main/browse?browseBy=type&filter=18

### 5) Explore the Semantic possibilities of Legal BERT and other alternatives for our L4 DSL
Actions:
- This dovetails with Item 3 in this report due to a common exploration of BERT.  The latest findings are listed in Item 3.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://github.com/maxloosmu/weekly-report/blob/main/Review%20of%20GPT4%20from%20a%20user%20perspective.md

### 6) Encode S10 of policy into L4 with considerations and trade-offs in comments
Actions:
- Nothing here this week.
- Some relevant links:
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u5aizEaRfnDJD7N0Zz4pJeBd3lMx36BdqKwdE-lppV8/edit#gid=0

### 7) Debug the multi-head code in vue-pure-pdpa
Actions:
- To attempt to resolve this problem, I successfully installed the repos vue-pure-pdpa and dsl, but I faced difficulties with the gsheet repo.  
- I have not tried poetry or docker for this task.  
- Some relevant links:
