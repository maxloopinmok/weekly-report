    - Each server data is backed up once every 3-7 days depending on the account type and server specification. We would like to note that these backups are made for server restoration purposes only. In Stellar hosting, there is no auto-backup menu so you will not be able to access these backups from your end. Also, please note that the backup creation depends on certain criteria. The following guide will be helpful: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/156/22/do-you-have-server-backups/

    - no backups at the server, data backup on user's PC
- does the 20GB include the space to install the wordpress blog platform?
    - Yes, the whole 20GB will be available to you. It is the full disk space of the hosting. The website data, emails etc will be stored in this space.
- are there ways to keep my domain name if i change website host away from namecheap?
    - Yes, the domain and hosting are two services. Even if the hosting is changed, it will not affect the domain.
- will unmetered bandwidth involve bandwidth trottling or additional costs if bandwidth limits exceeded?
    - We do not strictly monitor the bandwidth in Shared hosting servers. You will not face issues with bandwidth limit exceeding.
- can i manually delete files and emails on the server to avoid hitting the File (Inode) Limit?
    - Sure, you can do that via the File manager menu in cPanel. Please refer to the following guide to learn how to use file manager: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9700/29/how-to-use-file-manager-in-cpanel/

- where can i find your plans for managed hosting?
    - https://www.namecheap.com/wordpress/pricing/
- for the stellar plan at $1.98 per month, i'll be applying to pay it annually.  does this mean that after one year, prices will become $4.48 per month?  what if we pay biennially?  and the price of the domain name will be in addition to that?  
    - Yes, it is the initial purchase discount and the renewal price will be $4.48 after 1 year. For 2 year plans, the price will be $1.58/mo, the renewal will be the same.
    - Yes, the domain is a separate service, you have to purchase it additionally.
    - You can get a free domain name with Stellar hosting as well, with certain TLDs.
    - Free TLDs available: .fun, .host, .online, .site, .press, .store, .space, .pw, .tech, .website, .agency, .center, .digital, .live, .studio, .cloud, .shop.
    - You can purchase it along the hosting or you can get it after the hosting is purchased.
- i've been reading: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9365/2199/how-to-create-and-restore-backups-in-cpanel/#create.  backups take up disk space.  with a stellar plan, is it possible to delete all previous backups on the server before making a new backup?
    - Yes, sure, you can remove the previous full backups located on your account. They are saved in the Home directory in your file manager: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9700/29/how-to-use-file-manager-in-cpanel/#access
- if i get a .com domain through namecheap now, will my domain have a free SSL cert?
    - It depends on the hosting, not the domain name. If the hosting was purchased less than a year ago, it was provided with 50 free SSL certificates.
    - Here is the article about it: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9927/2218/1year-free-cpanel-positivessl-certificate-offer/
- if i buy a stellar plan now and pay biennially, are the domain prices and free SSL also biennial?
    - Regretfully, it is not applied to the Billing cycle you chose. The certificates are free for first hosting year for each Shared host with any Billing cycle.
- i want to setup a static wordpress page as my homepage and my blog will reside in a static page that is a child of my homepage, like this: yourdomain.com/blog.  is it possible to set up custom permalinks if i use softaculous to install the latest wordpress?  can i change the wordpress settings after installation?
    - Yes, sure. The permalinks can be changed at any time.
- do you have any written info about that?
    - Regretfully, we don't, but there are multiple guides online, like, for example:
        - https://10web.io/blog/how-to-change-permalink-in-wordpress/
        - https://wordpress.com/support/change-the-permalink-structure/
        - https://rankmath.com/kb/wordpress-permalinks/
- i want to setup a static wordpress page as my homepage and my blog will reside in a static page that is a child of my homepage, like this: yourdomain.com/blog.  is it possible to set up this structure if i use softaculous to install the latest wordpress?  how?
    - Am I correct that you would like to create a staging page?
- if you are referring to this: A WordPress staging page is a replica of a live WordPress website that allows users to test and update their website without affecting the live version. Staging sites are useful for preventing issues that can arise when updating plugins, themes, or WordPress itself.
- No, i want to use softaculous to install wordpress on my stellar plan website after i purchase it. and i want the structure to be static homepage: yourdomain.com, static blog page: yourdomain.com/blog.  how is this done?
    - It can be done in Softaculous via the clone option as shown here: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/1258/2182/how-to-work-with-scripts-in-softaculous/#clone
    - I am sorry for any misunderstanding you may have experienced. To create a static blog page, it is necessary to create a new WordPress installation for yourdomain.com and choose "blog" directory: https://img.namecheap.com/6BiHvJqQgzKsBdzUZKP4pQ.png
- sorry, i don't understand how that one picture works. if i add blog to the directory field, will wordpress include the root directory in the installation? because i'll need to include another static page in the root directory.  reading your article at https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/1255/2187/how-to-install-wordpress-using-softaculous/ does not give me any confidence..
    - Yes, if a new WordPress installation for yourdomain.com is created in 'blog" directory, you can upload any other content inside it as it will have its out path like home/cpanelusername/yourdomain.com/blog
- how do i use website builder to build my website on wordpress?
    - Please note that the Website Builder and WordPress are different services.
    - Here you can check more info about Website Builder: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/10028/2182/what-is-website-builder-and-how-to-use-it/
